  <h1>Hello folks!</h1>
  <p>It's a pleasure to be on Git!. Its'b been about year since I first craeted an account here.
    Originally I tried to use it as a tool to learn webdev, but sinec I study a lot philosophy and sociology I had to quit it...</p>
  <p><strong>UNTIL NOW!</strong></p>
  <p>As of 25th of February 2022 I decided to come back here and study not only webdev but a wide subject which is Computer Science in general.
</body>
I decided to participate in <strong>Harvardx CS50</strong> course and also learn and do stuff myself!</p>
<h2>My Intrests</h2>
<p>In general I don't have a great knowladge in computer science so it's hard for me to dig into specifics.</p>
<p>For now on I am intrested into studying how does computers and Internet works aswel as I try to code!<br />
  I know:</p>
<ul>
  <li> C - basically it's rather simple begginer knowladge about the language nothing to fancy.</li>
  <li> C++ - I started learning this language ever since I was in high school but I wasn't great at it. Now it's my main language that I use especially on codewars.</li>
  <li> Little of CSS and HTML - I still try to improve my skills on creating and maintaining a functional and clean looking website</li>
</ul>
<p>While I don't have anything specific to say about my intrests I can say that I want to study more of C and get a graps of C# - and then who knows.
  My futureself will probably be either a web developer or a game developer.</p>
<h2>Plans</h2>
<p>I am planning to fully get through CS50 course and my webdev course that I bought more less year ago. After that I will try to get a grasp from C# as I mentioned earlier and then do my own projects to build up my portfolio!</p>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>Currently I am learning C and C++, but I consider 2022 as the beginning of my journey in codding and programming in general!
 I am extremly ethusiastic about the upcoming year and ammount of stuff I will learn.</p>
<h3>Contact and Codewars</h3>
<p>I am a freshman let's say. I know not much exept some basic consepts so if you stumbled across my profile and want to share something with me I would be very greatful!
<br>Also here is my <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/WTCa">Codewar profile</a></p>
